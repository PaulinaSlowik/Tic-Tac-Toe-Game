## General info
>Game description and the course of the game:
1. The game is played by two players (a human plays "with the computer").
2. The playing area is marked with 4 intersecting lines: two vertical and two horizontal, each of which is divided into three equal parts by two lines perpendicular to it.
3. One player draws only a circle in the fields, the other only a cross.
4. Then the second player chooses a field and draws a different character than the first player (circle or cross).
5. Each player has one option to draw a field until all fields are occupied.
6. The goal of each player (to be the winner) is to make a line of three crosses or three circles.
7. When all squares are full and no line is formed, the game ends in a draw.
